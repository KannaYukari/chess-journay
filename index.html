        <p>In the land of the board, where kings do reign,</p>
        <p>Derik marched forth, with a steady campaign.</p>
        <p>But soon an old rival, with plans to unfold,</p>
        <p>Eldrich came slowly, both daring and bold.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>With courage and flair, a pawn leaped ahead,</p>
        <p>Fred shouted loud, "For the fight, we are led!"</p>
        <p>The board won’t be quiet—thrust and a dive—</p>
        <p>Eldrich himself struck hard, keeping threats alive.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Then Niccolo, the knight, leaped to the fight,</p>
        <p>And claimed where Eldrich had been in the light.</p>
        <p>But cunning and sly, black pawns did conspire—</p>
        <p>'Til Cyphus advanced, setting the board afire.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>With dreams of a plan, White’s heart did implore,</p>
        <p>Then clever Evans came, promising much more.</p>
        <p>He brought forth new trades, forged treaties with flair,</p>
        <p>But his peace was a façade, a trick to beware.</p>
